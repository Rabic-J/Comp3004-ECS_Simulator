Note i couldnâ€™t get my microphone to work so the recording so it has no sound 

I showed success scenario one then two then obstacle then overload then fire and power outage.

Success scenario 2 is different then what is found in the PDF document because all my elevators had passengers start on the first floors so I just showed that the ECS will send the closest elevator rather than relying on only one.

fire and power outage only move elevators to say floors if the trigger buttons are selected while the elevators are running
